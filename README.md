# SMD4GMS-release

.SMD skeletal animation for Gamemaker studio



Recommended to use in conjunction with Blender Source Tools



Supports up to 7 materials, this is a Gamemaker limit, not a framework one.



procedural animation is possible but not currently supported. This is an EARLY proof of concept, so please report any bugs or loading errors. For best results, animation node count and root model node count should be aligned and equal in number. The code can compensate, but it is limited and not perfect.



While intended for user created models, it can load those from Source games decompiled with Crowbar, but something to keep in mind this repository's goal is NOT to recreate Source engine features and shaders, so models taken from source games may look... odd.



For example, Chell's eyes in Portal 1 are mostly constructed at runtime in engine, and will appear as hollow sockets if loaded in this framework.
